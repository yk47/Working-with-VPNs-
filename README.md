## üßê Research: VPN Encryption & Privacy Features

-   VPNs use encryption protocols (such as OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec,
    WireGuard) to secure data transmission.\
-   They mask the user's IP address, preventing tracking by ISPs,
    advertisers, or malicious actors.\
-   VPNs provide secure access to public Wi-Fi by encrypting all
    outgoing and incoming traffic.\
-   UrbanVPN uses AES-256 encryption and strong protocols to maintain
    privacy.

## üìù Summary: Benefits & Limitations of VPNs

**Benefits** - Protects privacy by hiding real IP addresses.\
- Encrypts internet traffic, securing sensitive information.\
- Bypasses geo-restrictions and censorship.\
- Adds protection when using unsecured public Wi-Fi.

**Limitations** - Free VPNs may have limited server choices and
bandwidth restrictions.\
- Browsing speed can be slower due to encryption overhead.\
- Not all VPNs guarantee complete anonymity (logging policies differ).\
- Some services/websites block known VPN IP ranges.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

VPNs are powerful tools for enhancing online security and privacy. While
free VPNs like UrbanVPN provide essential protection, premium plans
offer better speed, more servers, and stronger features. For sensitive
activities, choosing a VPN with a strict no-logs policy and strong
encryption is recommended.
